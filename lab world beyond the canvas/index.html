    <h3>Hi Stevens!</h3>
    <p>This was my final project from last semester in my Advanced Animation class. The class expands on knowledge learned in AP Computer Science A and Principles, being more rigorous than both. This project was made using the CanvasRenderingContext in JavaScript. It's known as an ecosystem, where various elements interact with one another. For example, you'll notice that the triangle goes after the orange target and that the blue balls freeze if they're too close to the green ball.</p>
    <h3>Controls:</h3>
    <p>Use WASD to move around the canvas, or click on the minimap. Click on the canvas to generate a particle system at that specific point. Press F to flip the gravity on the particle system. If you hold it down, the particles won't be affected by gravity.</p>
    <p style="font-size:19px;">Try placing the particle system on the triangle and the snake! Watch what happens!</p>
